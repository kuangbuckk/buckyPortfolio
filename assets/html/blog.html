                    <br>
                    My name is Bach. Besides all the techno things, psychology also draws a lot of my attention as well as human developing, that's why
                    I'm a part of Psychology Makes Sense and co-founder of the Melta Community. 
                    <br><br>
                    Growing up as a boy in Ha Noi, Vietnam in the 2000s was one of the best experience for me when accessing Internet and computers was quite a
                    luxury thing to do in my decent family. I still remember how exciting it was playing sandbox games, surfing the Internet and everytime my brother
                    making some tricks on the computer. Therefore, it sparked my curiousity in the underlying system and the booming era of technology has hyped
                    me up to take part in the industry.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently, I'm a sophomore in a humble engineering university but it doesn't mean I will get limited in studying resources as well as chances.
                    Inspired by a lot of my friends, I have been learning in and outside of my classes, taking part in publishing scientific articles with my teacher
                    and leading the assistance group for it.

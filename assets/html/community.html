                    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/psychology.makes.sense/">Psychology Makes Sense</a> is a project made by a small friend group and our project aims to qualify and share precious knowledge to other 
                    friends. The reason was we noticed and discovered that in our generation, a lot of people have depression, but not everyone has someone
                    by their side to confide and share, or have knowledge to solve problems psychology of yourself as well as those around you. Therefore, we
                    have gathered together to build this team on the Instagram platform with the content of explaining psychology in an easy way to understand
                    and concise perspectives.

                    <strong>Melta Community</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    In order to help top individuals who wish to develop and achieve their own personal goals without finding a companion connect with high 
                    quality relationships, Melta was created. It was a a brilliant idea that cherised by my best friend Tuong Chun before the University Entrance Exam
                    and only one day after the exam, he asked me to conduct his dream. Initally, Melta was named Investment Fund because we wanted to establish
                    a community for trading stocks but after the incredible growth, we saw the potential of the people so that the community's whole system was rebooted
                    and became what it is today.
